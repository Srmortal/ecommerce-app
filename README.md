# Android E-Commerce App

---

## Project Idea  
An Android e-Commerce application built using Jetpack Compose that enables users to register, log in, browse products, search, add to cart, manage wishlist, and checkout. The backend uses Firebase for auth and SQLite for offline storage; product data is fetched via the DummyJSON API.

        *   Implement the **Settings Screen** (Essam).
        *   Integrate the Wishlist screen UI with its logic (Essam).
    *   **Sprint 5: Checkout & Integration**
        *   Build the **Checkout Flow** (may involve multiple screens).
        *   Integrate the Cart screen with the checkout process (Yousseff Alaa).
        *   Perform initial module integration and bug fixing.
*   **Deliverables:** A functional, feature-complete application after each sprint, with code merged into the main branch on GitHub.

- **Phase 4: Testing, Debugging & Polish (Week 8)**
*   **Objective:** Ensure the application is stable, performant, and user-friendly.
*   **Key Activities:**
    1.  **Unit & Integration Testing:** Write tests for critical business logic (e.g., cart calculations, data parsing).
    2.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Onboard at least 100 test users (as per KPI) and collect feedback on usability and bugs.
    3.  **Performance Optimization:** Profile the app to ensure it meets the **<2s response time** KPI.
    4.  **Bug Bash:** The entire team tests the app intensively to find and fix crashes and UI glitches.
    5.  **Final Review:** Conduct a final review of all code and user flows.
*   **Deliverables:** Test Report, Bug Fix Log, Performance Profile Report, Polished APK.

- **Phase 5: Launch & Presentation (Week 9)**
*   **Objective:** Showcase the completed project.
*   **Key Activities:**
    1.  **Prepare Final Presentation:** Create slides demonstrating the app's features, architecture, and how it meets the KPIs.
    2.  **Compile Complementary Products:** Gather all final assets (poster, demo video, GitHub repository link).
    3.  **Final Presentation:** Present the project to the instructor and peers.
*   **Deliverables:** Final Presentation Slides, Demo Video, Live Demo, Completed GitHub Repository.
